Hey Lucas I added a few things to this project:

I added the cocktail api search by name function (and I use it in my favorite drinks adapter when the user clicks on a drink to view the details of a drink they have favorited)

I added the ability to remove drinks from the favorites list (and that would also remove it from the firebase database)

I added the sign in with google button

I updated the fonts and colors of all of the gui pages so they would match
