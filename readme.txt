Notes about my project

I struggled a lot more with viewing my favorited items than I did with any other part of this app.

I can't have liked drinks persist between sessions unless I either ask the cocktail api for the info for the liked drinks or store all of the info for the liked drinks on firebase
for a few reasons I'm going to store it on firebase
1. I think it will be easier
2. I think it will be faster

If this were a larger scale application I would do the api calls so I wouldn't have to store so much redundant data but as this project is due in 12 hours and I work for 8 of those I have to implement
what I think I will have time for.
